Layers allow you to split your work into seperate sections and to add priority to different sections.
Layer priority works from top to bottom. For example layer 2 would be drawn over layer 1 if they havent been re-ordered.
Layers are also used as seperate frames for the animation tool.

Adding layers is as simple as clicking the add layer button.
Adding a new layer will change the selected layer to the newly added layer.

Removing layers is as simple as clicking the remove layer button.
You cant remove a layer if there is only one layer.
Removing a lyer will remove any work on that layer so be carefull when deleting layers.

A layer can be made invisible by clicking the eye button.
Pressing the same button will make the layer visible again.
This does not erase any work done.
